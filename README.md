# 🤖 AI PR Reviewer

Welcome to **AI PR Reviewer** – a GitHub Action that uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** to review your code just like a human reviewer would, but faster! It adds **inline comments** directly on your Pull Requests, helping you catch bugs, improve code quality, and follow best practices. 

This tool is designed to save you time, maintain high coding standards, and make the code review process a breeze.

## 🚀 What It Does
- **Inline Comments on PRs** – AI leaves comments directly on lines of code that need attention.
- **Smart Suggestions** – It looks for:
  - Code improvements and best practices
  - Security enhancements
  - Performance optimizations
- **Live Demo Included** – There’s a demo project with an open Pull Request, so you can see the AI in action right away.
- **Continuous Feedback** – Automatically runs every time you open or update a Pull Request.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Triggered by Pull Requests**  
   - It runs whenever you open or update a PR.
2. **Analyzes the Full Code Diff**  
   - It checks all the changes made in the PR using GitHub’s API.
3. **Powered by OpenAI**  
   - The AI reviews the code and gives feedback on quality, security, and performance.
4. **Leaves Inline Comments**  
   - Comments appear directly on the lines of code in the PR, just like a human reviewer.

## 📦 Tech Behind It
- **GitHub Actions** – Handles the automation for CI/CD.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo** – Does the heavy lifting with intelligent code analysis.
- **cURL & jq** – Used for making API calls and processing JSON.
